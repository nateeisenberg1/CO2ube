<p style="color:green;">Pollution has been a devestating pandemic across the globe during the era of technology. There seems to be no slowing down in the advancements, so how can we solve this issue to save mother nature?

       <strong><p> What is it?</p></strong>
            <p>The excess of Carbon Dioxide in our atmosphere is a form of highly dangerous pollution. As CO2 levels rise in response to the increase in CO2 emmissions from cars, factories, and our own increased population, and in response to the decrease in plant life remaining on the Earth.  </p>
            <p>    This increase in the amount of CO2 in the air is one of the most critically dangerous and controversial topics concerning the Habitability of the Earth. The more CO2 that is in the air, the less sunlight is able to escape the atmosphere after reflecting off the Earth. This creates what is called "The Greenhouse Effect" the process that causes the gradual warming up of the Earth, aka, <em>Global Warming</em> </p>
                
                
                
                <p> CO2 emitting from vehicles including trucks, jeeps, cars, trains and airplanes cause immense amounts of pollution. Although they are a necessity to our needs of transportation, the overuse is killing our environment. </p>
                
                           <strong><p>Effects</p></strong>
                          
                           <li><p>Respiratory Health
                               <p>The effects of Air pollution are alarming. The kind of pollution that typically accompanies CO2 emmission is known to create several respiratory and heart conditions along with Cancer, among other threats to the body] Children in areas exposed to air pollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma.

                                                               <li><p>Depletion of the Ozone Layer
                                                                   <p>Ozone exists in earth’s stratosphere and is responsible for protecting humans from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Earth’s ozone layer is depleting due to the presence of chlorofluorocarbons, hydro chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. As ozone layer will go thin, it will emit harmful rays back on earth and can cause skin and eye related problems. UV rays also have the capability to affect crops.
                                                                       </li></p>
 <strong><h1>Did you know that...?</h1></strong>
                
                
            <p class="ptag"> <strong> "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2013, CO2 accounted for about 82% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle (the natural circulation of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals). Human activities are altering the carbon cycle—both by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere and by influencing the ability of natural sinks, like forests, to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While CO2 emissions come from a variety of natural sources, human-related emissions are responsible for the increase that has occurred in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution." </strong></p>

    <h1>Our Invention</h1>th 
    <p> <em>In order to solve the issue of excess carbon dioxide, we developed an idea that will counteract and begin to reverse the emmission of CO2 and the effects of high CO2 levels! </em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Our invention, the <strong>CO2UBE</strong>, is a cylindrically shaped "CO2 Vaccuum", that travels at high speeds through the air high above cities with high CO2 emmisions

      <h1>About 2,000 years ago</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Greenhouse gases were emitted from Greenland at least 2,000 years ago</li>
            <li>The ancient Romans kept domesticated livestock like cows, sheep and goats which exrete methane gas</li> 
            <li>The Chinese, during the Han Dynasty, polluted by fashioning weapons, which required to burn wood <br>and rice farming brought over many methane producing bacteria</br></li> 
            <li>Agriculture increased methane emissions around the world</li>   
          </ul>
        </p>
      
      <h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Industrial Revolution introduced many sources of water and air pollution <br>such as the increased use of coal</br></li> 
              <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <li>The Industrial Revolution pollution caused "anti-pollution" days such as: Earth Day, Clean Air Act(1970), and Clean Water Act(1972)</li>
            <li>In the 13th century King Eward I of England, in an effort to reduce pollution, threatened Londoners with penalties if they kept using sea-coal</li>
          </ul>
        </p> 
      
      <h3><strong>From the 20's to Modern Day</strong></h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>In 2007 46% of all americans resided in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone, or smog</li> 
            <li>In 1969, chemical released into the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, which caused it to burst into flames<br>this made the waterway a symbol of how industrial pollution was destroying american nature</br></li>
            <li>In 2007, CNN reported that "up to 500 million tons of heavy metals, solvents and toxic sludge slip into the global water supply every year" </li>
            <li>According to UNESCO, 70% of industrial waste is dumped untreated into rivers and lakes </li>
            <li>According to GreenPeace, around 70% of China's lakes and rivers are polluted from industrial waste, this causes 300 million people to use these polluted water supplies</li>
            <li>In 2006, the ENS reported that more than 62% industrial and municipal facilities across the country<br>discharged more pollution into U.S. waterways than their Clean Water Act permits</br></li>
            <li>In 1989, the Exxon Valdez crashed and spilled about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sea<br>This oil spill caused a 3,000 square-mile oil slick, killed thousands of birds,fish and other animal-life in the area</br></li>
